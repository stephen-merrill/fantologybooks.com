Not only does this book contain many memorable moments, but it also has us reflecting on the nature of good and evil and how we as humans deal with the tragedies of life. Our characters here don't necessarily deal with them well, as they're all tragically flawed although no less compelling for it. Plus, Cosca: lovable mercenary or mask-requiring wholesale conglomerate?",

Stephen and Ryan recap the first two Gods of Blood and Powder books before breaking down the exciting conclusion. If you're looking for a nice combination of military fantasy, political machinations and well defined magic all wrapped around a layer of frontier flintlock fantasy, then this is the series for you! Plus, it's usually a good thing when a book reminds you of Brent Weeks' Lightbringer series...right?",

However, there were some amazing and memorable moments too - who can't appreciate holy water balloons and vampire being crushed by frozen turkeys?
