Not only does this book contain many memorable moments, but it also has us reflecting on the nature of good and evil and how we as humans deal with the tragedies of life. Our characters here don't necessarily deal with them well, as they're all tragically flawed although no less compelling for it. Plus, Cosca: lovable mercenary or mask-requiring wholesale conglomerate?",
